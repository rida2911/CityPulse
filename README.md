##  How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rida2911/CityPulse.git
   cd CityPulse
   ```

2. **Run the frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. **Run the backend**
   ```bash
   cd ML
   # If Jupyter Notebook is used
   jupyter notebook SmartModel.ipynb

   ```
## **Project Overview**
    CityPulse uses historical, sensor-based, and satellite data to intelligently forecast air pollution levels (AQI), detect unusual patterns in both traffic flow and air quality, and recommend smart travel routes. It        also provides interactive dashboards to assist government authorities in planning, monitoring, and making data-driven decisions for city management.

### **Key Features:**
1.  Traffic & AQI Prediction using LSTM, Prophet
2.  Smart Routing via AI
3. Dynamic City Dashboard
4. Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest
5. Real-Time Data Integration from sensors & APIs
6. AI Feedback Loop for performance improvement
7. API Integration: Google Maps
